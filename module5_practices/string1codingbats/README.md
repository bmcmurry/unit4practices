## Description:

You will be implementing a multiple page app, where each page shows one of the three strings.

You should have a "home page" where it has links to the three other expected pages.

Each page should have a link that goes back to the home page.

## To Do:

[ ] - Home Page with three links to the other pages.
[ ] - The other pages should have a link back to the home page.
[ ] - First page should be based on the coding bat String-1 Left2 where it rotates a given string left 2. It should ask for a string and then it should rotate it to the left two.
[ ] - Second page should be based on the coding bat String-1 combo_string where it takes two strings and sets the second string outside of the first string.
[ ] - Third page should be based on the coding bat String-1 first_half where it takes a string and returns the first half of the string.
[ ] - All forms once submitted should show the result at the bottom of the page.
