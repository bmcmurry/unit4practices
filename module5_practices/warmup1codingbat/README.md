# README

## Description:

You will be implementing a multiple page app, where each page shows one of the three strings.

You should have a "home page" where it has links to the three other expected pages.

Each page should have a link that goes back to the home page.

## To Do:

[ ] - Home Page with three links to the other pages.
[ ] - The other pages should have a link back to the home page.
[ ] - First page should be based on the coding bat Warmup-1 sum_double where it is given two integer values and returns their sum.
[ ] - Second page should be based on the coding bat Warmup-1 diff21 where it is given an integer value and returns the absolute difference of n and 21.
[ ] - Third page should be based on the coding bat Warmup-1 sleep_in where it is given two boolean fields (these when implemented into django will look like check boxes!) where the first field asks if it's a weekday and the second if we are on vacation. We only sleep in if it's a vacation or it's not a weekday. Return True if we sleep in. It should say at the bottom of the screen "We can sleep in!" or "We can't sleep in!"
[ ] - All forms once submitted should show the result at the bottom of the page.
